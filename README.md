## General info
This is my first bigger web project.
It's a web application that is used to help people remember their tasks at home and who is the turn now e.g
- buy milk,
- take out the garbage,
- whose turn to clean the bathroom? etc.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Symfony 4
* AJAX inserts
* Doctrine
* Twig
* Template from https://www.creative-tim.com/product/light-bootstrap-dashboard
* Bootstrap 4
* and the rest of the code... :)
	
## Setup
This project will be soon available in the Internet.
